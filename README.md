## Quick start (using the app)
1) Go to Home and enter keywords (e.g., "frontend developer"), plus a location if relevant.
2) Select a Job Type if you want to narrow (e.g., Full‑time, Part‑time, Contract).
3) Click Search Jobs to see results.
4) Use filters/sorting to refine and open a job to see details.
5) Click Apply (or follow the application instructions) and optionally Save the job.

## Advanced search with the Boolean Builder
- Exact phrase: "product manager"
- Must include all: react AND typescript
- Either term: designer OR ux
- Exclude term: python NOT django
- Combine: (react OR vue) AND typescript AND "frontend developer"

Tips
- Start broad, then add one constraint at a time.
- If results drop to zero, remove NOT terms or quotes.

## Jobs page features
- Filters: job type, possibly location and more (depending on data available)
- Sorting: relevance or recency
- Pagination: move between result pages
- Cards: open a job for full description and application options

## Job details and applying
- Review description, requirements, compensation (if provided), and location.
- Use Apply to begin the application flow. Some roles may redirect to the employer site.
- Use Save to keep it in your Dashboard for later.

## Companies

## Dashboard

## Chat (optional)

## Troubleshooting
- No results: broaden keywords, remove quotes/NOT terms, clear filters.
